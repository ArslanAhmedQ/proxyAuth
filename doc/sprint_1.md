# Sprint 1

## Accomplishments
* PAM that logs to a file when the user authenticates via GDM login (GUI GNOME Desktop Login Screen)
* Android App that scans the bluetooth devices
* C program that scans the bluetooth devices

## Participants Contribution:
* **Sean Coutinho:** Kotlin Android Application that can detect nearby bluetooth devices
* **Ju Hong Kim:** Linux PAM that logs to a file whenever a user logs in via the GUI Desktop login
* **Daniel Wang:** Implement a bluetooth scanner in C that detects nearby bluetooth devices
* **Arslan Qamar:** Set up the VM, Worked On Linux simple pam, fixed the errors, and was able to login. 
* **Anurag Bist:** Java Android Application Implementation

## Goals for Next Sprint (Will be subject to change)
* Android app that messages via bluetooth to the desktop (not read, just write)
* PAM - authenticate user if the bluetooth device is within the vinicity (no protocols nor any authentication scheme)
* Write a Python or C program that reads input from the mobile device via bluetooth

## To Improve in the Next Sprint
* Assign user stories to members
* Increase communication between members (including direct messaging users to check Slack if they are unresponsive)
* Give enough time for each member to prepare something before meeting together

## PROBLEMS
* Setting up VM and all the dependencies
* Setting up Android Studio
* Setting up the Android emulator to run the Android Application
* Some memebers did not know what to work on and want user stories to be assigned to them

## Extra Information
* Read `doc/kim_log_1.md` for details about what Kim did for the week
