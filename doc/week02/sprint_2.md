# Sprint 2

## Accomplishments
* PAM that logs in via bluetooth after detecting the device
* Android App that sends a simple message via bluetooth to the desktop
* C program that reads a single message sent by the Android app via bluetooth

## Participants Contribution:
* Ju Hong Kim: 
    * wrote C program that reads a single message sent by the Android App
    * wrote the PAM to login after detecting the device
    * tested and fixed a minor bug on the Android communication with the C program

## Goals for Next Sprint (Will be subject to change)
* Android app that messages via bluetooth to the desktop (not read, just write)
* PAM - authenticate user if the bluetooth device is within the vinicity (no protocols nor any authentication scheme)
* Write a Python or C program that reads input from the mobile device via bluetooth

## To Improve in the Next Sprint

## PROBLEMS
* Bluetooth **[BLOCKING]**: Memebers need an external bluetooth adapter to be able to work on their assigned tasks.
    * we cannot get our VM connected with our built in bluetooth adapter and we believe that we need an external bluetooth adapter to have our VM detect our bluetooth adapter.
