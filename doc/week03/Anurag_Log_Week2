## 1. Worked on bluetooth adaptor connection

## 2. Researched the use of bluetooth in the background (for the app)

## Bluetooth adaptor

  Setup
  - Followed instructions on bluetooth adaptor packaging 
  - Installed drivers 
  
  VirtualBox setup
  - Select settings (for the virtual machine)
  - In 'USB' tab, select USB controller (i.e. 2.0 or 3.0) 
  - Then add the filter by selecting the bluetooth adapter (BCM920702 in this case)
  
  Challenges and Errors
  - Even after installing drivers for the bluetooth adaptor, it seems to have errors
  - The drivers for the bluetooth adaptor interfere with the laptop's built in bluetooth's adaptor
  - The adaptor did not appear inside the VirtualBox
  - Need to find a solution to this (because the adaptor worked with MAC OS)
  
## Bluetooth in the background

  START_STICKY flag
  - Service is restarted when the parent app terminates when using the START_STICKY flag
  
  App Life Cycle
  - There is no way to continue the bluetooth connection once the app is closed
  - All app processes have the same lifetime as the app itself
